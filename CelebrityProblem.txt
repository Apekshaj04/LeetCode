A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. 
A square matrix mat is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is set to 1 it 
means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist,
return -1.


class Solution:
    def celebrity(self, mat):
        n=len(mat)
        a=0
        b=n-1
        
        while a<b:
            if mat[a][b]==1:
                a+=1 
            else:
                b-=1 
        candidate=a 
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i!=candidate:
                if mat[candidate][i]==1 or mat[i][candidate]==0:
                    return -1 
        return candidate
